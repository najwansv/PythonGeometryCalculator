# PythonGeometryCalculator

The Project Python Geometry Calculator is a program that allows users to perform various geometry calculations for 2D and 3D shapes. The program is written in Python and can be run from the command line or as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application.

The program supports a variety of shapes, including circles, triangles, rectangles, spheres, cubes, and more. Users can input various parameters such as radius, height, width, and length, and the program will calculate properties such as area, perimeter, volume, and surface area.

In addition to its core functionality, the Project Python Geometry Calculator from 2D and 3D can also include a formula dictionary to provide users with easy access to common geometry formulas.

The formula dictionary can be implemented as a separate module or integrated into the main program. It can contain formulas for various geometric properties such as area, perimeter, volume, surface area, and more. Users can search for a specific formula by keyword or browse through the dictionary to find the desired formula.

The project is useful for students, educators, or anyone who needs to perform geometry calculations regularly. It can also be used as a learning tool to teach basic and advanced geometry concepts.

Overall, the Project Python Geometry Calculator from 2D and 3D is a versatile and valuable tool for anyone who needs to perform geometry calculations quickly and accurately. With its user-friendly interface and support for various shapes and calculations, it provides a powerful solution for geometry-related tasks.
